## Machine Learning Project: Fraudulent Job Advertisements Classification
This project focuses on the classification of job advertisements to identify fraudulent postings. By analyzing various features such as job descriptions, requirements, benefits, and company profiles, we aim to distinguish between genuine and deceptive job ads.

## Project Overview
### The project is divided into two main parts:

### Part A: Data Preparation and Initial Analysis
+ __Data Collection & Sensing__: Comprehensive data collection from online job postings, followed by static sensing to convert samples into raw data.
+ __Exploratory Data Analysis__: Investigation of dataset characteristics, such as the balance between genuine and fraudulent job postings, common words in job titles, requirements, and more.
+ __Pre-processing__: Data cleaning including handling missing values and duplicates, normalization, and feature extraction.
### Part B: Model Development and Evaluation
+ __Model Training__: Application of various machine learning algorithms including Decision Trees, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
+ __Model Evaluation__: Performance comparison using metrics like AUC-ROC and confusion matrix analysis.
+ __Improvement & Final Predictions__: Hyperparameter tuning and model selection based on evaluation results.
