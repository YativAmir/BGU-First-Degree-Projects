# IIOT
## IoT Algorithmic Modeling and Efficiency Comparison Project
### Overview
This project focuses on the algorithmic modeling and efficiency comparison of Distributed Stochastic Algorithm for Maximal Graphical Models (DSA MGM) through the simulation of agent interactions within an IoT framework. Our goal was to minimize the overall cost associated with the domain assignments of 30 agents, each having a domain size of 10, with neighbor connections based on a probability factor K.

### Features
+ Implementation of 30 agents with domain sizes of 10.
+ Cost analysis in agent domain assignments.
+ Efficiency comparison between DSAMGM implementations with varying parameters.
### Graphical Results
+ __Graph 1__: Illustrates the relationship between parameter P (the likelihood of a better assignment in DSA) and the final cost provided by the algorithm.
+ __Graphs 2 & 3__: Display the average global costs of three algorithms over 30 runs for different K values (0.2 and 0.7).
### Discussion and Conclusions
+ Analysis of the cost against changes in P, highlighting the efficiency of the algorithm under different conditions.
+ Comparative results showcasing the performance of DSAMGM with different P values and MGM algorithm, emphasizing the optimal P value range for minimizing costs.
