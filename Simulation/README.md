# Simulation
## Wedding Hall Guest Experience Simulation
### Overview
This project aims to simulate the guest experience in a wedding hall. Focusing on optimizing the guest flow and service efficiency within a budget, we've explored various scenarios to enhance the overall guest experience. The simulation model was built using RStudio, considering multiple guest paths, service stations, and resources allocation.

Features
Simulation of guest experience from arrival to departure, including interactions at various service stations.
Evaluation of service efficiency at food stations, bars, and seating arrangements.
Analysis of potential improvements such as additional waiters, food stations, and bar capacity enhancements.
Statistical comparison of different optimization strategies within the specified budget.
